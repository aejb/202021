    "Monte Carlo calculations are a class of calculations that barely existed before the advent of computers. A Monte Carlo method is a technique that involves using random numbers and probability to solve problems. The term Monte Carlo Method was coined by *S. Ulam* and *Nicholas Metropolis* in reference to games of chance, a popular attraction in Monte Carlo, Monaco (*Metropolis and Ulam, 1949*). Monte Carlo simulation is a method for iteratively evaluating a deterministic model using sets of random numbers as inputs. This method is often used when the model is complex, nonlinear, or involves more than just a couple uncertain parameters. A simulation can typically involve over 10,000 evaluations of the model, a task which in the past was only practical using super computers."

We also ensure that our [division behavior is sensible](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/) by importing from `__future__`:  _i.e._, promotion to `double` will occur from `int` or `long` data types involving division:  `1/2 == 0.5`.  Although this is the default in Python 3, it is a trivial way to help this notebook work in Python 2 if that's what you are using."

    "One of the problems that you will encounter when working discrete data sets will be, for example how do you decide if your simulated value is above/below a curve if your random point does not match up with a value in your data file.  Here the data file will not have values for $f(x)$ at the randomly generated value of $x$, and you do not have a functional form of the equation such that you could evaluate the function at any arbitrary value.\n",

    "One simple solution is to use the *scipy.interpolate* package to generate a new value of *f* in-between the values that you have already. The following code example fits using some data from the CRXO website and *scipy.interpolate.interp1d* to interpolate both *linearly* and using a *cubic spline* fit to evaluate the function at some arbitrary values of *E*. An alternative would be to use *curve_fit* with a trial function (maybe a higher order polynomial to fit the whole data set), or to divide the data up into bins in $E$, and assign a mean value if $f$.\n"
