    "## Object Oriented Programming Week11: Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "So far your programs will have been designed around functions or blocks of statements which manipulate data. This is called the procedure-oriented style of programming. There is another way of organizing your program which is to combine data and functionality and wrap it inside a *class*. This is called the **object oriented programming** OOP paradigm. Most of the time (as in the case for all of the exercises so far) you can use procedural programming but sometimes when you want to write large programs or have a solution that is better suited to it, you can use object oriented programming techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the **main** problems with the procedural programming paradigm that you will have all encountered so far comes when you want to perform operations using functions with additional parameters, so far I have seen lots of code with a number of functions defined *f1,f2,f3..* where the only difference between each function is that it contains a different set of parameters. This is okay when you have only a few instances but would become unmanageable if you needed 100. Before I discuss the OOP solution I will demonstrate the problem with an example.\n",

    "Consider the vertical motion of a ball thrown in the air, from Newton's second law of motion you can set up a mathematical model for the motion of the ball and find that the vertical position of the ball, $y$, varies with time $t$ according to the following formula:\n",
    "$$y(t)=\\upsilon_{0}t-\\frac{1}{2}gt^{2}$$\n",
    "Here, $\\upsilon_{0}$ is the initial velocity of the ball, $g$ is the acceleration of gravity. Observe that the $y$ axis is chosen such that the ball starts at $y = 0$ when $t = 0$. \n",
    "* Conceptually, in physics, $y$ is a function of $t$, but $y$ also depends on two other parameters, $\\upsilon_{0}$ and $g$, although it is not natural to view $y$ as a function of these parameters.\n",
    "* We could write $y(t; \\upsilon_{0}, g)$ to indicate that $t$ is the independent variable, while $\\upsilon_{0}$ and $g$ are parameters. \n",
    "* Strictly speaking, $g$ is a fixed parameter (if we are the surface of the Earth), so only $\\upsilon_{0}$ and $t$ can be arbitrarily chosen in the formula.\n",
    "* It would then be better to write $y(t; \\upsilon_{0})$.\n",

    "The use of global variables is in general considered bad programming. Why global variables are problematic in the present case can be illustrated when there is need to work with several versions of a function. Suppose we want to work with two versions of  $y\\_vertical(t; \\upsilon_{0})$, one with $\\upsilon_{0}=1$ and one with $\\upsilon_{0}=5$. Every time we call $y\\_vertical$ we must remember which version of the function we work with, and set $\\upsilon_{0}$ accordingly prior to the call.\n",
    "Another problem is that variables with simple names like $\\upsilon_{0}$, $a$, and $A$ may easily be used as global variables in other parts of the program. These parts may change our $\\upsilon_{0}$ in a context different from the $y$ function, but the change affects the correctness of the $y$ function. In such a case, we say that changing $\\upsilon_{0}$ has side effects, i.e., the change affects other parts of the program in an unintentional way. This is one reason why a golden rule of programming tells us to limit the use of global variables as much as possible.\n",

The following statement constructs an instance bound to the variable name y:\n",

Actually, $Yvertical(3)$ is automatically translated by Python to a call to the constructor \\_\\_init\\_\\_ in class $Yvertical$. The arguments in the call, here only the number 3, are always passed on as arguments to \\_\\_init\\_\\_ after the self argument. That is, $\\upsilon_{0}$ gets the value 3 and *self* is just dropped in the call. This may be confusing, but it is a rule that the *self* argument is never used in calls to functions in classes.\n",

From now on we will use this terminology. In our sample class *Yvertical* we have two methods,\\_\\_init\\_\\_ and *value*, and two attributes, $v0$ and $g$.

The original class is still available and the separate child class is small, since it does not need to repeat the code in the parent class.\n",
