It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and the abilty to create publication-quality figures in many formats."}

{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"### Standard Header\nAs we will be utilizing a number of packages with reasonably long names, we will adopt the _de facto_ standard module abbreviations in the following header.  We also ensure that our [division behavior is sensible](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/) by importing from `__future__`:  _i.e._, promotion to `double` will occur from `int` or `long` data types involving division:  `1/2 == 0.5`.  Although this is the default in Python 3, it is a trivial way to help this notebook work in Python 2 if that's what you are using."}
